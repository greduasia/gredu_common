# GREDU COMMON
is an common widget / utils or helper library we made for all type application. whatever application you made, **GreduCommon** it will help you reduce your fucking time on development process

---

### Rules for Developer:

0. add CHANGELOG.md | update `pubspec.yml` version

1. If you wanna write new function / utils / etc. don't forget to create unit testing for that scope.

2. make sure structure folder `root & test` must be same.

3. make sure all test passed!

4. Use annotate `@visibleForTesting` as a sign that the function has been tested. 
   so that it is more visible than otherwise necessary, to make code readable. ref : https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/meta/visibleForTesting-constant.html

5. [optional] create sample documentation for every function you write.
